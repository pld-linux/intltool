- release 2,
- added merge_lines patch with merge each multiline sed commands in
  xml-i18n-tools.m4 to one long line.
  This will fix divide by autoconf place all substitution to more than one
  scripts with sed substitutions. Sometimes during output files from autoconf
  some sed commends are not placed in one script file and all fails. Lines
  are longer and harder to reading but all can work coorectly.
